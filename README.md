# Titanic | First project as a Data Analyst ⭐️

Proyecto Titanic 


This was my first project as a Data Analyst, i did not wanted to edit anything as a reminder of how i improved and anybody can improve like me.


The Titanic data analysis paper analyzed a dataset containing information about the famous ship's passengers. 

The analysis focused on the relationship between various passenger characteristics, such as their gender, age, and ticket class, and their survival during the sinking of the Titanic. 

Women were found to have a significantly higher survival rate than men, and ticket class was also related to survival. 

Additionally, data visualization was used to show these relationships clearly and effectively. 

In summary, the Titanic data analysis provided valuable insight into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the historic maritime disaster.
